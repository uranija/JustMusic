# JustMusic

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Music app which would allow a user to play audio files. There are many music player apps, and they make a wide variety of design choices. It will be your job to decide what kind of music app your structure would turn into and build out that structure using intents. Will you build an app to play music from the userâ€™s library of music? Will you build an app to stream random songs from a database? Will you build a musical suggestion engine? Those choices are up to you!
